# simple-prism
Quick summary of project my friend Gilad and I worked on in late 2017 called Simple Prism. This was during the cryptocurrency hype phase and we realized that some of my friends in finance were interested in investing in crytpocurrency but didn't know how. 

We set out to built an application that allowed people to invest in cryptocurrencies (from BitCoin to ICO's) based on a consumers risk appetite. The PitchDeck as well as video pitch provides a bit more detail as well. We ended up designing and building a preliminary web application and soliciting a small amount of money from family and friends.

We also applied to a few accelerators and got an interview with Y Combinator, and flew out to California on their dime. We ended up interviewing with YC partners but at the end of the day, we did not get in as they did not believe we had a comparative advantage in investing in specific cryptocurrencies (and in retrospect the crytpo markets took quite the nose dive). We ended up putting the project on hold as both Gilad and I were doing full-time roles. 

Regardless, this was a fun little project to work on!
